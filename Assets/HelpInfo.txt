**How to use the bot?**

The bot works with a simple prefix. Currently, its set to `!`. 
You can send this prefix followed by a command word in the chat to trigger commands.

Eg: *`!help`*

Commands can have arguments too!

Eg: *`!help apply`*

When using the help command, make sure of the following.

```md
# < arg >
- Required
# [ arg ]
- Optional
# [ arg... ]
- Can include multiple words
```
